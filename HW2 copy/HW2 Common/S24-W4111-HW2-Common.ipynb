There are different ways to interpret a NULL value, such as a value that is missing, unknown, not applicable, or just a placeholder to be filled later. Unlike other approaches, NULL values maintain standardization across different database systems. They are also automatically excluded from statistical calculations unlike other values such as -1, and this provides more accurate calculations.

So, the join condition is only based on the name of the attribute, which may be problematic as it does not take into account any foreign key relationship. If the two tables that are natural joined have columns with the same name but different meanings or data types, the result will be unexpected and incorrect. An example would be the attribute \"phone number\" for two different tables: customer and company. The attribute name for these columns are the same but they mean different things and have different functions, where the \"phone number\" for customer is a personal phone number and the \"phone number\" for company is the company phone number. Natural joining these two tables would be incorrect as it would only take the rows with same phone number, despite these phone numbers referring to different things, which would lead to data loss of different valued rows of phone numbers."

    "Many database queries target a limited subset of records within a table, rather than the entire dataset. Reading through every record to locate one with a specific value is a resource-intensive process. By implementing an index on a table's attribute, a database system can quickly identify tuples in the table that match a given attribute value, eliminating the need to examine each tuple in the table comprehensively. An index would be considered unnecessary if it is not often used by a query or it is redundant because some other compound index already covers it. Creating unnecessary indexes in a database leads to increased storage requirements, as each index occupies additional space. These surplus indexes slow down data modification operations (inserts, updates, deletes) due to the overhead of maintaining the indexes in sync with the table data."
