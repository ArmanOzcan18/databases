    "Structured data is highly organized and formatted in a way that is easily searchable in databases. It is based on relational table and adheres to a robust schema, meaning it is organized into tables with rows and columns, where each column has a specific data type and the rows collectively represent a record. This type of data is easy to enter, query, and analyze using standard tools and methods, such as SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-structured data does not reside in a relational database but still has some organizational properties that make it easier to analyze than unstructured data. It doesn't fit neatly into tables, rows, and columns but contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. The semi-structured data model permits the specification of data where individual data items of the same type may have different sets of attributes, which contrast structure data model. JSON and XML are widely used semi-structured data representations.\n",

    "Unstructured data is information that does not adhere to a predefined data model or is not organized in a predefined manner. It is the most common form of data found in the real world and mostly includes text but other data such as images, videos, and audio. Unstructured data is typically stored in formats that are difficult to process and analyze without advanced tools or techniques. Examples include PDF documents, text, emails, etc. Analyzing such data often requires advanced techniques such as image analysis techniques, et natural language processing, etc."

This ensures uniformity and integrity in how databases are handled, emphasizing the relational capabilities as the fundamental mechanism for all database operations. \n",
    "1. Metadata: The information about tables, columns, constraints, and indexes should be stored in system tables within the database itself. The rule dictates that metadata operations, like querying table schemas or altering constraints, are performed through standard relational operatons rather than other mechanisms. This is the reason the Information Schema is part of the ANSI SQL standards, which provides read-only views about the metadata.\n",
    "2. Security: The database management system should enforce access controls, user permissions, and data encryption using its inherent relational capabilities. For instance, user authentication and authorization can be managed through relational tables storing user credentials and permissions. Access control mechanisms, such as granting or revoking privileges on tables and views, should be implemented using standard SQL commands. Encryption of sensitive data can be achieved through relational techniques such as column-level encryption or using relational encryption functions provided by the RDBMS."

Having non-atomic keys creates problems for indexes. The data retrieval could possibly be slow despite the index; if the queries often involve only one part of the non-atomic key, such as the section number here, then the index on the entire non-atomic would not efficiently speed up the data retrieval, compared to an index directly on the section number. Also, when parts of a non-atomic key change, the index may need to be updated. If only a portion of a non-atomic key is modified, such as the section number, the index entries for all the related data need to be updated, which can be complex and time-consuming. In general, it's harder to adapt indexes to changes in data structure when non-atomic keys are used.\n",

Natural join: A natural join is an operation in relational databases that automatically matches and joins tables based on columns with the same names, outputting all pairs of rows from the two tables that have equal values in all matched columns. It removes the duplicate columns involved in the comparison, only keeping one of each compared column.\n",
    "2. Equi-join: An equi-join is a particular type of theta join where the join condition is based on equality between specified columns in the two tables. It returns only the rows that have equivalent values for the specified columns. Unlike natural joins, equi-joins require specifying the column names explicitly in the join condition.\n",

    "4. Left join: A left join outputs all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, the result becomes NULL on the side of the right table for that row.\n",

    "7. Inner join: An inner join combines rows from two tables, returning only those rows where there is a match found in both tables based on some join condition. The join condition is explicitly specified, unlike in a Natural Join. Inner join can be considered as the default join type in SQL."

    "1. Cascading actions in the context of foreign key constraints refer to the automatic triggering of updates or deletions across related tables (children of the referenced parent table) when a change is made to a row in referenced table. These actions ensure data integrity and consistency across the relational database. Instead of cascade, one could also use \"set null\" (which sets the values in the foreign key columns of the children tables null) or \"set default\" (which sets them to some specified default value).\n",
    "2. Cascading actions can be helpful for the foreign key relationship between _orderdetails.orderNumber_ and _orders.orderNumber_. If an order is cancelled/deleted from the orders table, cascading delete actions can automatically remove all associated order details from the orderdetails table, ensuring that the database does not keep any details of a non-existent order. Or, if an order's number changes for some reason (although it would be unlikely for a primary key to changed), a cascading update action would ensure that all related entries in the orderdetails table are also updated. These cascading actions can simplify the maintenance of database integrity, by automating the update and delete operations across related tables, eliminating the possibility of human error originating from manual maintenance."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "e7550ee2",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "_Answer:_ Here are the two reasons why using associative entities to implement a relationship would be necessary or advantageous compared to only using foreign keys:\n",
    "1. A direct many-to-many relationship cannot be efficiently implemented using only foreign keys because a single record in one table cannot reference multiple records in another table without duplicating data. An associative entity works as a bridge between the two tables, allowing each record in one table to be linked to multiple records in the other table by instances of that associative entity. For example, the entities \"Researchers\" and \"Projects\" may be connected through an associative entity because each researcher can be in multiple projects and each project can have multiple researchers.\n",
    "2. For some relationships, there could be a need to store information about the relationship itself, not just about the entities being linked. An associative entity can be used to store such attributes effectively. For example, the \"Advisor-Advisee\" associative entity linking \"Students\" and \"Teachers\" may store additional information about the advisor-advisee relationship such as the date the advisor teacher started advising the student or the particular topic of advising. These attributes are specific to the relationship between an advisee student and advisor teacher and do not belong to either the Students or Teachers table alone, which is why we use an associative entity to hold this relationship-specific information in a organized and easily retrievable way."

    "Procedures and functions enable “business logic” to be stored in the database and executed from SQL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Database stored procedures are sets of SQL statements that are stored and executed on the database server. They can handle complex operations, such as data manipulation and transaction management. They are able to take \"in\" and \"out\" keywords as parameters that are expected to have values assigned to them and parameters whose values are set in the procedure in order to return results. A procedure can be used to both read and modify data and may or may not return a value. They are used for data validation, complex business logic implementation, etc.\n",

    "2. Database functions are similar to stored procedures in that they encapsulate SQL code for reuse, but they are designed to return a single value or a table based on at least one parameter as input. The can only read data but not modify data. One can execute a function inside a stored procedure, but one cannot execute a stored procedure from a function. They are usually used for data formatting, calculations, and basic data retrieval operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Database trigger is a statement that is executed automatically by the system as a side effect of a modification to the database. One must 1) specify the conditions under which the trigger is to be executed and 2) specify the actions to be taken when the trigger executes to design a trigger mechanism. They can change data and have no return value. They are often used to trigger custom actions to specific changes, automatically update audit logs, enforcing complex integrity constraints, etc."

    "1. Views abstract complex queries into a simpler form. One a view is defined, the user can access it any time and further manipulate it without having to rewrite all the querying that the view already implemented before. Therefore, views are helpful in accessing the results of complex queries in an abstracted way, and without even using extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Views can function as a way to restrict access to specific subsets of data, which provides security. The database administrator is able to only expose a certain part of the data by creating a view and keeping other sensitive data hidden. For example, a view can be used to remove a column for SSN number for some table, making sure the users cannot access the SSN numbers of other people, which maintains security.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Views can be also used provide personalized or customized to fit the particular needs of different type of users or applications. For example, the marketing department may utilize a view that highlights campaign performance and customer engagement metrics, whereas the finance team might access a different view that brings together budget allocations and expenses. This tailored approach makes analyzing data more efficient because users can focus on the most relevant information for their purposes."

That is because MySQL automatically creates an index for the foreign key column when a foreign key constraint is defined. The idea is that foreign key constraints require checking the referenced value in the referenced table, so an index allows this check to be quite faster."
